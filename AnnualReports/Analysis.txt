FY 2010:
--------
1) Shriram Transport Finance Company Limited (Shriram Transport) is India’s largest asset financing Non Banking Financial
Company (NBFC) with total Assets Under Management (AUM) amounting to Rs. 29,126 crores. A flagship company of the
Chennai-based Shriram Group, Shriram Transport provides accessible and affordable Commercial Vehicle (CV) finance to
more than 7 lac customers through 484 branches across India.
2) The performance of India’s new CV industry is directly linked to the country’s macroeconomic growth, especially industrial
growth. In contrast, the correlation of the used CV sales to the macro economy is much less, driven in part by replacement
demand and by the aspiration of truck drivers to graduate to a CV owner.
3) During 2009-10, the CV industry posted a rebound with new vehicle sales rising 34.6% y-o-y (in volume terms) as
against 22% down during 2008-09.
4) The growth in new CV sales is expected to remain strong in FY11 on account of heightened manufacturing activity, buoyant
consumption, evolving distribution and service networks, easy availability of finance and road development programmes.
In the wake of the above factors, Indian Medium & Heavy Commercial Vehicle (M&HCV) sales are expected to grow at
a CAGR of 13% over FY09-12E
5) Normally, a CV’s ownership changes more than once, re-financed an average of four times in its lifespan with history
the first change of ownership happening in the 4th or 5th year of purchase.
6) Given the fact that a large number of CVs sold during FY05-07 are expected to witness probable change in ownership in
the near period and would be available for refinancing over FY10-12, the pre-owned CV industry is expected to witness 
bigger growth
7) CV sales (number of vehicles) are well below car sales in India (CVs are around 50% of the value of car sales).
However, the size of the financing markets for the two segments are quite comparable due to the significantly
higher finance penetration in the commercial vehicle A large percentage of CV fleet (of medium and large fleet
segment (over 95% of the new sales are financed)
8) CVs sold during boom of 2004-07 will start hitting the resale market.
9) Generally, freight capacity growth is 1.25-1.5 times the GDP growth
10) The ban on overloading by Supreme Court will significantly enhance the demand for CVs in the system
11) Legislative pressure on banning 15-year old trucks is likely to trigger the replacement boom. Transport 
associations have suggested Voluntary Retirement Schemes for old trucks. If these old trucks are to be replaced, 
it will create a trigger in replacement demand for 11 lac CVs.
12) Massive investments in the roads and highways sector to support growth According to the NHAI, India’s road 
network is nearly 33 lac kms. Approximately 65% of freight and 85% of passenger traffic is carried by the road network.
13) The construction equipment industry is estimated to be worth approximately USD 6 billion (~Rs. 30,000 cr), with	
an annual growth forecast of 25-30% The scope for expansion in this space is immense; given that majority of 
asset purchases are financed
14) The Company has initiated measures to develop pre-owned CV hubs across India called ‘Automalls’ through a wholly owned subsidiary Shriram Automall India Limited. Automalls will provide a ready platform for pre-owned CVs. The platform would be used by the Company to earn a fee based income as well as strengthen its product valuation knowledge. The first Automall is expected to begin operations by second quarter of this year. Another 50-60 Automalls are expected to come up over the next 12-18 months.
15) The Company maintained a CAR of 21.35% during FY10 against a minimum 12% as required by RBI norms.
16) During 2009-10, the Company opened call centres, to regularly keep its customers informed about their account 
It also introduced a ‘mobile banking’ feature for its customers, enabling them to get real-time information on their account particulars.
17) Almost two-thirds of the Company’s total monthly collections are in the form of cash, due to the underdeveloped banking habits of STOs. Lack of proper cash management can lead to a loss for the Company.
18) In March 2010, the six key sectors i.e. crude oil, petroleum refinery, coal, electricity, cement and finished steel posted an annual growth of 7.2 per cent as against 3.3 per cent in March 2009, boosting prospects of a robust across the board growth.
(JSW share grew 560 % in FY 2010 wow!)
19) Company issued Non Convertible Debentures and raised a sum of Rs. 99,999.96 lacs

FY 2011:
--------
1) Business Verticals: 
		1) Commercial Vechicle Finance: (Market share)
			Preowned Vechicle	: 25 % 
			New Vechicle		: 8 %
		2) Construction Eqipment finanace.
		3) Auto Mall, New Look and one stop (retial and fianance)
2) The total commercial vehicle (CV) segment accounts for about only 5 percent of total automobile sales in India. The Indian Commercial Vehicle (CV) Industry is the lifeline of the economy. Approximately 66 percent of the goods and 87 percent of the passenger traffic in the country moves via road.
3) The trends have clearly indicated that the CV demand is closely correlated with GDP growth rate (more strongly with the Index of Industrial Production, IIP) of the country and therefore, it is believed that a growth or slowdown in CV demand is a harbinger of an upturn or down turn in the economy respectively.
4) We expect India’s demand for commercial vehicles to remain strong. India’s stock of commercial vehicles is currently low at 6 vehicles per thousand people versus 11 for China and 48 for other Asian peers.
5) Construction equipment market is pegged at Rs. 16,980 crores in 2009, growing at a CAGR of 22 percent. It has been expected that spending on construction equipment in India will reach Rs. 1.8 tr between 2007-15.
6) Government of India has allocated INR 1.66 tr (2010-11) to infrastructure growth indicating strong commitment to the development of infrastructure in India. Construction expenditure will increase by Rs. 1,218,900 crores from 2008-09 to 2012-13 on account of government expenditure.
7) Rental business in India is considered to be at a very nascent stage Estimated share of equipment sold to rental companies is 10 percent in India as compared to 50 percent in developed countries
8) Established in 1979, Shriram Transport Finance Co Ltd. is the largest asset fi nancing NBFC with Rs. 3,608,602.63 lacs worth of assets under management. The company is a leader in organised fi nancing of pre-owned trucks with strategic presence in 5-12 year old trucks and a market share of 20-25 percent. It has a pan-India presence with a network of 68 SBUs and 488 branches, and has built a strong customer base of over 7.5 lacs
9) The company has been providing asset finance for the last three decades. It has enabled more than a million aspiring individuals to emerge as entrepreneurs. Some of the customers of the company, graduated to fleet-owners – first moving from pre-owned to new commercial vehicles and then from trucks to other commercial vehicles, such as passenger buses. As a result, the company continued 
to finance its established customers across related asset class
10) The Company’s total external borrowings increased from Rs. 1,845,990.96 lacs as of March 31, 2010to Rs. 1,988,171.30 lacs as of March 31, 2011. The company has a strategic mix of retail deposits and institutional funding with retail liabilities constituting 22.4 percent of the total external borrowings (against 17.7 percent as of March 31, 2010) and loans from banks and institutions  accounting for 77.6 percent (against 82.3 percent as of March 31, 2010).
11) INTEREST RATE RISK: 
While the Company borrows at both fixed and floating rates, it lends at a fi xed rate. If the Company has a large proportion of borrowings at a fl oating rate, a sharp fl uctuation in interest rate may lead to a reduction in the Company’s net interest margin. Higher interest cost would also lead to a higher cost of lending which may reduce the attractiveness of the Company for borrowers and affect the Company’s ability to grow its business.
Risk mitigation:
Majority of the Company’s loan portfolio qualify as Priority Sector assets for banks, which enables the Company to raise funds at lower costs.
12) The Company is also increasing its proportion of long-term loans by borrowing from the retail sector and raises funds through the securitisation route.
13) Novel cash management checks are employed at every level and regular audits are conducted to ensure the highest levels of compliance

FY 2012:
--------
1) Commercial vehicle sales in India increased 18.2% year-on-year in 2011-12, but sales of medium and heavy commercial vehicles (M&HCVs) rose a muted 7.9% as compared to 37.2% in 2010-11. This decline was on account of high interest rates on loans, contracting industrial production and a spike in vehicle prices.
2) In a recent report on the commercial vehicle industry, ICRA said that although the near-term risks against M&HCV demand has increased, the demand over a longer period remained intact. It projected long-term growth outlook for M&HCV of 9.5-11.5% CAGR and for LCV of 11-13% CAGR over the next fi ve years.
3) The trucking industry is going through some changes. In the M&HCV segment, the share of heavy-duty, long-haulage trucks (16T+) is increasing, on account of improving road and highway infrastructure as well as increasing availability of such vehicles. In the LCV goods segment, share of sub 1T segment is on the rise with the emergence of the hub-and-spoke model and increasing demand for last mile connectivity.

FY 2016:
--------
1) The Chinese economy is being hampered by a slowdown in imports and exports and declining investments and manufacturing activity. This is causing a spillover effect on other economies linked with trade channels. Japan received the single-biggest downgrade for any country with GDP declining by half to just 0.6% in Financial Year 2016 as compared with 1.2% in Financial Year 2015. Moreover, oil prices have fallen dramatically, which resulted in excess of production over consumption.

--------
FY 2017:
--------
1) The year was marked by major events namely demonetization of specified bank notes, conclusion of legislative assembly elections in five states, passage of Goods and Services Tax (GST) Bill by the Parliament. On November 8, 2016, the government announced the demonetization of ₹500 and ₹1,000 denomination notes, thereby rendering 86% of the cash in circulation as invalid.
2) The decline in cash in circulation had led to increase in bank deposits with a resultant decline in interest rates on deposits, loans and government securities as well as a decline in real-estate prices, increase in savings, digitalization, income disclosure with a resultant increase in collections by tax and other local authorities.
3) The immediate effect of demonetization was on the daily wages/ earnings of the contract and unskilled labourers employed in highly labour intensive, unorganized sector, construction, transportation sectors etc. These sectors are more dependent on cash for working capital requirements. There was a temporary decline in demand due to shortage of cash. This had caused layoff of contract workers, disruption in production activities due to manpower loss, etc.
4) However, after witnessing healthy growth of 13% in the first quarter, the growth momentum came to a grinding halt from June 2016 onwards as Medium and Heavy Commercial Vehicle (M&HCV) (Truck) started witnessing sudden contraction. Waning replacement demand along with uncertainty related to the impact of GST on vehicle prices put brakes on M&HCV (Truck) sales as fleet operators held back on their fleet renewal or addition plans on expectations that vehicles prices may fall once GST is implemented

--------
FY 2018:
--------
1) Union Budget proposed to levy long-term capital gains tax of 10 per cent on gains exceeding Re. 1 lakh from sale of equity shares
2) The unseasonal spike in the prices of vegetables and the full impact of the central government implementing the 7th Central Pay Commission’s HRA award impacted Headline CPI infl ation reaching 5.2 per cent in December 2017 (4.9 per cent, excluding the estimated impact of HRA for central government employees). The headline inflation was down at 4.4 per cent in February 2018(4.1 per cent, excluding the estimated impact of HRA for central government employees).
3) The sectors which are likely to register growth rate of over 7.0 percent are ‘public administration, defense and other services’, ‘trade, hotels, transport, communication and services related to broadcasting’, ‘electricity, gas, water supply and other utility services’ and ‘fi nancial, real estate and professional services.
4) Th e ‘agriculture, forestry and fi shing’, ‘mining and quarrying’ and ‘manufacturing’ sectors are likely to show a growth rate of 3.0%, 3.0% and 5.1% respectively in its GVA during 2017-18, as against the previous year’s growth rate of 6.3%, 13% and 7.9%  respectively.

6) The total managed NBFC-retail credit of NBFCs stood at around ` 7 trillion as on December 31, 2017, posting a year-on-year growth of 18.3 per cent, compared with nearly 15.5 per cent in FY 17 and 19 per cent in FY 16. Th e announcement of the bank  recapitalization plan by the Government should help credit growth overtime
7) All major components of capital fl ows, viz., foreign direct investments (FDI), foreign portfolio investments (FPI), non-

March 31, 2018 vis-à-vis 120 days as on March 31, 2017
10) Issue of Rupee Denominated Bonds Overseas under the Medium Term Note Programme (‘Masala Bonds’):
